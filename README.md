# Fundamentals-of-Machine-Learning-and-DataScience

This repository is the code companion to learn the "Fundamentals of Machine Learning and Data Science" with examples. It has been attached with documentation for better understanding about the concepts of Data Science and Machine Learning from basic to adavcecd level. Aim of this repo is to make everyone familiar with the machine learning concepts,  handling the data science project effecitively and deploying it in realtime environment. The contents are modulated as chapter-wise, considering the environment setup, library and packages installation, working with various machine learning libraries, theorotical undertsaing about the algorithms, implmeneting it for different realtime datasets and deployment.

# ------------Steps for installation of Visual Studio code------------------

Visual Studio Codeis one of the most commonly and effectively used programming tool in the industrt, commonly referred to as VS Code. It is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. This is light weight plugin platform supporting mutiple langugaes including, Python, C, C++, Java, html, css and Javascript etc. 

Download the software from below link(w.r.t your os configuration)-

•	https://code.visualstudio.com/download

•	Install the VS code downloaded in the system
 
# ---------------Steps for installation of python----------------------------

•	Download the latest version of python through the link -> https://www.python.org/downloads/

•	Install the latest version of python downloaded by givging all the confirmation(deault path adding can be choosen at this step)

•	Check whether  python installation path is added to environment varibales?? 

•	If not added, add it manually by going to environment variables in the system
