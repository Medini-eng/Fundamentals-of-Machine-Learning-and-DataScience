# Fundamentals-of-Machine-Learning-and-DataScience

This repository is the code companion to learn the "Fundamentals of Machine Learning and Data Science" with examples. It also been attached with documentation to get better understanding about the concepts of Data Science and Machine Learning from basic to adavcecd level. Aim of this repo is to make everyone undertand about the concepts,  handle the data science project effecitively and deploying it in realtime environment. The contents are modulated as chapter-wise, considering the environment setup, library and packages installation, working with machine learning libraries, theorotical undertsaing about the algorithms, implmeneting the algotithms for different realtime datasets and deployment.
